/*
Pseudo code:

Main goals:
1. Create a 10x10 grid
2. Create ships, that the user can't see in random positions
  - Ships can just be rectangles of diffierent sizes, it's just an mvp
3. Check if the user clicks on one of the 'ships' if they do, change the color and reveal it to the user
4. Let user know when they got all the ships

Extra credit:
1. Create a way to reset the board
2. Track the users score
  - Number of hits
  - Number of ships remaining


Other:
1. Mark where the user has hit
2. Maybe get some sort of wave effect for the background

Example future goals (Things that you'd do after you create a working MVP, don't worry about them for this though it's an MVP project)
1. Stop any overlapping
2. Random Orientation
3. Graphics for ships and missles
4. Visual effects
5. Moving ocean background
etc...
